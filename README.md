JAVA Paint app using SWING
Hi!

in this program i used SWING library because i found it easier to handle the paint processes using it;

So these are some instructions to follow:
-You can run the app by executing the PaintApp.java file on your device;
-You can also use it by just opening the PaintApp.jar file;
-You can control the window dimensions by dragging the borders;
-You can pick the color from the three colored buttons or use the "fill" button to choose from a lot of colors! ;
-In case you used the "clearAll" button don't forget to press on the Drawing area to enable it;
